				Mustadio grew up a very scholarly life in the Bastion Protectorate. Spending much of
				his life studying, tinkering, and investingating every object he could get his hands
				on. He is the son of the acclaimed artificer, Balthasar Van Helmont. A brilliant
				Gnome Alchemist whose knowledge of Arcana and Chemicals was consistently tapped upon
				by many in the Bastion. Balthasar had dissappeared, for unknown reasons, about a
				century ago. Some speculate he was kidnapped. Others saying he went rogue, gone mad
				with knowledge and power. The rumors of his dissappearance spanned the entire
				spectrum, and it felt like a new rumor started everyday. But one thing was certain
				to Mustadio: he was a great father.
				<br />
				<br />
				Mustadio adored his father, who always was encouraging in his son's tinkering and
				studying. He always supported Mustadio's goals and was always there to guide him.
				Until one night he left for some Alchemical work and simply never returned.
				Balthasar's dissappearance is a mystery to Mustadio. And one he aims to solve.
				Wrench and flasks in hand, Mustadio leaves his home and sets upon a journey to
				become an Alchemist as great his father. And hopefully find out what truly happened
				to him.
